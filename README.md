# Python:
- Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
- A Versatile Programming Language
- Python is a powerful, high-level, and easy-to-learn programming language that is widely used in various domains, including web development, data science, artificial intelligence (AI), automation, and more. It is known for its readability, simplicity, and extensive libraries.

## Key Features of Python
- Easy to Learn & Use – Python has a simple syntax that is similar to - - English, making it beginner-friendly.
- Interpreted Language – Python does not need to be compiled; it runs - directly from source code, making debugging easier.
- Dynamically Typed – No need to declare variable types; Python automatically assigns data types.
- Cross-Platform – Works on Windows, macOS, Linux, and more.
- Huge Standard Library – Includes built-in modules for handling tasks like file I/O, networking, and databases.
- Object-Oriented & Functional – Supports multiple programming paradigms.
- Applications of Python
## Web Development
- Python can be used to build web applications using frameworks such as:

- Django – A high-level framework for building secure and scalable web applications.
- Flask – A lightweight framework for small-scale applications.
- FastAPI – Used for building high-performance APIs.
2. Data Science & Machine Learning
- Python is a leading language in data science and AI with libraries such as:

- NumPy, Pandas – For data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib, Seaborn – For data visualization.
- Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch – For machine learning and deep learning.
## Automation & Scripting
- Python is commonly used for automation tasks like:

- Web scraping (BeautifulSoup, Scrapy).
- File handling and batch processing.
- Automating reports and repetitive tasks.
## Game Development
- Python supports game development through libraries like Pygame and Panda3D.
## Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking
- Used in penetration testing tools like Scapy and Metasploit.
## Database Handling
- Python can interact with databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite using libraries like SQLAlchemy and PyMongo.
## Internet of Things (IoT)
- Python is used in Raspberry Pi and embedded systems for IoT projects.

## Python Install 
- Many PCs and Macs will have python already installed.
- To check if you have python installed on a Windows PC, search in the start bar for Python or run the following on the Command Line (cmd.exe):
- `C:\Users\Your Name>python --version`
- `python --version`
- If you find that you do not have Python installed on your computer, then you can download it for free from the following website: https://www.python.org/


## Python Quickstart

- Python is an interpreted programming language, this means that as a developer you write Python (.py) files in a text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed.
- The way to run a python file is like this on the command line:`C:\Users\Your Name>python helloworld.py`

- Where "helloworld.py" is the name of your python file.

- Let's write our first Python file, called helloworld.py, which can be done in any text editor. 

## Python Version
- To check the Python version of the editor, you can find it by importing the sys module:

```python
import sys

print(sys.version)
```
